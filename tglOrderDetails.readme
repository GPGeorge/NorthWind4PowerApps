The code in tglOrderDetails.txt should be placed in the OnSelect action of a command button.
It assumes the existence of input controls on the screen matching the controls in the OnSelect.
It assumes the existance of a hidden control that has the Text property: gvTGLReorderQuantity  
gvTGLReorderQuantity is a boolean that toggles between true and false.
When gvTGLReorderQuantity changes, the toggle button for which it is the Default value reacts by invoking its OnChange event.
That, in turn, triggers the code to execute the stored procedure and receive the response.
