Code and documentation for the project to create a PowerApps version of the Northwind Developer Edition Template in Access.

This repository contains a script to recreate the NorthWind Developer Edition database in SQL Server.
    This will require you have a cloud-based server on which to install the database to use it with PowerApps.
    The database can be created on a local server but PowerApps won't be able to connect to it with a Gateway, 
    which is beyond the scope of the project at present.
    
In the future it will contain the app package to create a version of the application in your Power Platform development environment.
